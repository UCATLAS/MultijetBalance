Welcome to MultijetBalance's documentation!
===========================================

This is the automated documentation for the ATLAS Multijet Balance calibration software
and is relevant for Run 2 in 2016 and beyond.
The original twiki for 2015 data in Run 2 can be found on the `MultijetBalanceRunIIFramework <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasProtected/MultijetBalanceRunIIFramework>`_.

The methods performed here are documented for the `7 TeV Jet Calibration <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-3190-y>`_,
`8 TeV dijet and multijet calibration <https://cds.cern.ch/record/2008678>`_,
and the upcoming `8 TeV Jet Calibration <https://cds.cern.ch/record/2048678>`_.
